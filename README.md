> Zooplankton are often located in patches across a surface, the phenomenon of which is unclear. Measuring the distribution of the zooplankton is important, but difficult with either gulpers or sippers (escape velocities of some flora/fauna may bias the sampling). Using heterogenous teams shows promise.
